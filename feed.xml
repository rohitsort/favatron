                <p>It looks like Google flagged your Gmail account due to suspicious activity after you logged in from a USA RDP. Since your phone number is not being accepted for verification, follow these steps to recover your account:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Use Google Account Recovery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a rel="noopener" target="_new">Google Account Recovery</a>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>"Forgot Password"</strong> or <strong>"Try Another Way"</strong>.</li>
<li>If Google asks for an old password, try entering any previously used password.</li>
<li>If you see the option to verify via email or phone number, try to receive an OTP and verify.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Try Incognito Mode or a Different Browser</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Open your browser in <strong>Incognito Mode</strong> (Private Browsing) and try logging in.</li>
<li>Use a different browser like <strong>Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Log in from a Trusted Device</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you previously logged in on any device (phone or laptop), try signing in from there.</li>
<li>Google may allow access from a recognized device and location.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Use a VPN to Log in from a USA IP</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If your account is still locked, try using a <strong>VPN with a USA IP</strong> and attempt logging in.</li>
<li>You can use VPN services like <strong>ProtonVPN, ExpressVPN, or NordVPN</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Contact Google Support</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a rel="noopener" target="_new">Google Help Center</a>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>"Canâ€™t sign in to your Google Account"</strong> and look for <strong>"Get Help"</strong> or <strong>"Contact Support"</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6. Wait for 48-72 Hours</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes Google places a temporary lock due to security reasons.</li>
<li>Wait <strong>48-72 hours</strong>, then try logging in again.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still face issues, let me know, and I can suggest further steps.</p>
